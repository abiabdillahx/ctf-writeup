# WebDecode

### Author: Nana Ama Atombo-Sackey

## Description

### Hints
```md
1. Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.
2. The flag may or may not be encoded
```

## Solution
Ok, Once you launch the instance, we'll get the webite. We can see that it has 3 Page from its source code (Ctrl + U).

</br>
I just click on every page to see their source code. I can see that the flag is encoded in the source code of the **about.html** page.
< _gambar source about >
</br>
It seems like it's a **base64** encoded text. So, just decode it using this command and you'll get the flag we need. Or... you can use online tools like [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) or [dCode](ode.fr/base-64-encoding).
