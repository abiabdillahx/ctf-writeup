```md
1. How is the password checked on this website?
```

## Solution
In this challenge, we have to launch our instance from **picoCTF**. Once you launch it, you can access their website. You will see this in the web
<_gambar tampilan awal_ >
</br>
Then, i just try to input random username and password. And it says "Log In Failed". We can see the source code of this page by pressing "Ctrl + U". Then you will see there is a _javascript_ in `script` tag.
< _gambar source code login.php_ >
</br>
I clicked the `secure.js` and directed to new page. Damn, it's the login logic for the main page. I just can use the username and password from this page to login on Main page.
< _gambar source code secure.js_ >
</br>

So, once we use the right username and password, we'll got the flag.
