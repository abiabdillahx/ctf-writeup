### Author: zaratec/Danny

## Description
Can you find the robots? [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474

### Hint :
What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution
After i tried to search about the hint, i found that the hint is talking about the robots.txt file. This file is used to tell th robots where they can and can't go on the website. So i went to the website and i typed in the url bar: http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:36474/robots.txt. Then you will see this
