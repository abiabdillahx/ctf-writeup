## Solution
As we can see here, we have to input some data like name, address, phone number, and password. I put any random string and number there and got directed to `/dashboard` page. But, we have to input a **2FA Authentication** too. So, i just open this web using **burpsuite**.

Firstly, we need turn the 'intercept' on. Then, open the browser.
After that, you can right click the request to send it to **Repeater**.

Then, we can see the request in **Repeater**. We can modify the request here. Just try "Send" it and all we got is HTML code that have an input field like 2fa.
But, there is a vulnerability here. You can just change the request method from **GET** to **POST**. Then, send it and we got the flag!!!
