## Description
Can you get the flag

## Solution
Launch the instance first. After that, you will see a button "Say Hello" that if we click it, it'll give a hint _"This code is in a separate file!"_. So, what we need to do is to find the file that contains the code. We can do this by using inspect element or press **"Ctrl + U"** on ur keyboard.

Oh, there are 2 files in this web (style.css and script.js). We can just see the code of both and u'll see the separated flag. Combine it and u'll get the flag.
