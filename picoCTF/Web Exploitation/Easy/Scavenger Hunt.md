# Scavenger Hunt
### Author: madStacks

## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/. Can you find it?
### Hint
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solution
1. So, the first step i did is view the web source code (**Ctrl+U**). I saw this comment line for the first flag part

2. Then, i realized there are 2 more source page (`mycss.css` adn `myjs.js`). See both of them, and you will get the 2nd part of the flag in `mycss.css`. When i saw the `myjs.js`, they said **"How can I keep Google from indexing my website?"**.
3. There are some ways to not indexing ur page to google. But, the common way is using **_Robots.txt_**. So, just add `/robots.txt` in the URL path.

4. Next, the 4th part is in a server path. It's `/.htaccess`. Just access it and we'll get the 4th part.
5. It said **"I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."**. For Mac, there is a special folder named `.DS_Store`. Just go on it and that is the last part

Combine all of it
