# GET a HEAD
### Author: madStacks

## Description
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/

## Solution
As i see here, there is a simple HEAD request to the server. So, we can use **curl** in terminal to solve this challenge. Use this command
```sh
curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/
```
This will return the HTTP headers of the server, and the flag will be in the "flag" field. So, we get the flag!
