# Unminify
### Author: Jeffery John

## Description
I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!
Browse [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:61566/), and find the flag!

## Solution
Ok, launch the instance first.
When i check the website, it has a static page. So, just inspect the website by pressing **"Ctrl + Shift + I"** or **"F12"** and i will see this. Don't forget to wrap the line code.
