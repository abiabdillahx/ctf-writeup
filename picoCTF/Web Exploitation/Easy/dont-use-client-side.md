## Description
Can you break into this super secure portal? [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/17682/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:17682

## Solution
So, the first thing i did is inspect the source code of the webpage. I noticed that the password is stored in a javascript function `verify()`. It's splited into pieces. So, just rearrange them and combine the to get the real flag.
