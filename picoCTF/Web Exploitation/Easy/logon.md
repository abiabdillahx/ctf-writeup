## Description 
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/15796/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:15796

## Solution
Firstly, we get the link to the website. We can see that there is a login form. I just write a random username and random password and i enter the `/flag` page

After that, i try to see if there are cookies on this website. And there are. As u can see, we can edit the value of **admin** cookie. I edited it from `False` to `True`.
