# Insp3ct0r
### Author: zaratec/danny

## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: [link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/9670/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9670

## Solution
Once u enter the website, u can inspect the source code by right-click and click "view page source" or just press **"Ctrl + U"** on keyboard.
The code is a simple web server written in html, css, and js. As u can see, there is a comment line that says it's the part 1/3 of the flag.

then, u can check check another page by clicking on the link `mycss.css` and `myjs.js`. Just search the other flag parts there and you can combine the parts.
