### Hints
```md
1. How is the password checked on this website?
```

## Solution
In this challenge, we have to launch our instance from **picoCTF**. Once you launch it, you can access their website. You will see this in the web.

Then, i just try to input random username and password. And it says "Log In Failed". We can see the source code of this page by pressing "Ctrl + U". Then you will see there is a _javascript_ in `script` tag.

I clicked the `secure.js` and directed to new page. Damn, it's the login logic for the main page. I just can use the username and password from this page to login on Main page.

Back to the login page. So, once we use the right username and password, we'll got the flag.
