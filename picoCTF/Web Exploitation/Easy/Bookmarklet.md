# Bookmarklet

## Description
Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?

## Solution
Ok, launch the instance first, then you will see this in main website.

If you click the textbox right there, it'll be automatically copied to your clipboard. So, just run the javascript that has been copied to a compiler. You can use an [online compiler](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/online-compiler/) if you can't run it locally. Run it. Then, we got the flag!!!
