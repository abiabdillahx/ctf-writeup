### Checking Out of Winter

**Description** </br>
> We took our annual road trip to Baja California Sur to visit the beach and play some golf. I like how this location is farther from the city compared to other resorts. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory sauce on the pizza with shredded chicken. After eating, I fell asleep, and half of my legs ended up getting tanned.

Question: Which hotel did Adam stay at? </br>

**Solve**
So, basically we just search for the hotel in Baja California Sur with golf course and pizza with shredded chicken. I find about "Baja California Sur first because idk what it is. But, when i search resorts in that area, it has so many resorts with **golf** and **beach**.

I have tried almost all of golf resorts in Baja California Sur, especially from this [blog](https://www.tripadvisor.com/HotelsList-Baja_California-Golf-Resorts-zfp7841950.html). Until i found the correct one, it is **"Hilton Los Cabos Beach and Golf Resort"**. I was using this word in google search

### Sleuths and Sweets
**Description**
> I visited my friend in Japan, and we had some alright crepes! The area had a lot of foot traffic, so we expected a long wait, but it was worth it. I’m usually not a fan of yogurt in my crepe, but it still tasted pretty alright.

Question: What is the address of this location? </br>

**Solve**
From the blog, i found a picture that maybe can be a "signature" of a shop or a restaurant. It's **Price Tag**.

I search the photo with _Google Lens_, the i found this price-tag is from "Marion Crepe" in Japan. So, i thought it just has one shop. So, i thought it's Marion Crepe in Ueno Ameyoko, then i realized the clue for this chall, `"The area had a lot of foot traffic"`. So, that's Shibuya, right?! I found a website that helps tourist in japan to search anything, [_JapanTravel_](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/area/jp/search/?word=marion%20crepe).

Damn, Marion Crepe has many shop. So, I tried it one by one and got the right address in Jinnan, Shibuya.

### Late Nite Bite
**Description**
> Some nights, I enjoy walking out to this modern local izakaya restaurant. They close pretty late, which makes it perfect for a late night snack. What makes this place unique is their dedication to brewing their own teas and constantly experimenting with new dishes on the menu. I like to order their mocktail Shiso Dry as my drink. As for meal spicy tuna onigiri with a bowl of miso soup is enough for me.
> I just want to show my appreciation and admiration for this place. But you guys will never find it! I regularly come here during the weekends.

**Solve**
Ok, i will say this challenge sucks. At first, i thought izakaya restaurant is literally in Japan. So i search any popular izakaya restaurant in Japan without any clue. Then, i realized there is an 'about' page in Adam's blog. He said "I’m Adam Holmes, a food blogger based in Southern California" and provide an image of his town.

So, i just use google lens and found out that he lives in Santa Monica, California. I tried to search with all keywords that i have, "izakaya", "santa monica", "mocktail shiso dry". I found a blog that write about it [here](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Izakaya&find_loc=Santa+Monica%2C+CA). Then i found this [post](https://www.instagram.com/shirube_santamonica/p/DELJLUWO7Ip/). Damn, it's the right place!!
So, **Shirube** is the answer
